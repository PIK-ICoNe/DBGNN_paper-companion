# DBGNN-Trajectories

Trajectories for the DBGNN layer, randomly initialized, all node and edge features 0, except at node 1.

```generate_publication_figures.jl``` generates the full set of figures from which the figures for publication were chosen.

## Figure 4 images are from: path/oscillatory_4d with the following names:
